A lightweight general purpose JavaScript DOM element popup class.

This single class can create tooltips, dropdown menus, modal and non-modal popup elements. Popups can be draggable and have auto-close or click-to-close functionality. Scriptaculous effects can be applied when opening and closing popups. Behavior can be customized with over a dozen options, but the defaults are reasonable and options are often not required.

The script is Prototype based and uses Scriptaculous effects and dragdrop libraries (which come by default in Ruby on Rails projects).

Also included are examples showing how to use DOM Popups with Ruby on Rails to create rich information popups and modal forms (AJAX and non-AJAX).

Take a look at the demo page to see DOM popups in action.
